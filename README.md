# PrestaShop Custom Download Link

This is a PrestaShop module allowing to set a custom download link for a virtual product.

The custom download link is to be set on the Virtual Product tab.

If the `GetFileController` detects that a custom download link is provided for the product, it will redirect to this link, hence taking precedence on any upload file.
